        <p>No. We're on the top. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Actually, that's still true. Pansy.</p>

<p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? No! The cat shelter's on to me.</p>

<p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>

<p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>

<p>Hey, whatcha watching? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?</p>

<p>Say it in Russian! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</p>

<p>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Soon enough. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?</p>

<p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
